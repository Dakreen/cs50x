# CS50x – Introduction to Computer Science

This repository contains my personal solutions and notes for [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/), Harvard University's introductory course in computer science.

CS50x is part of my career transition into IT, cloud computing, and cybersecurity. It builds a solid foundation in computer science, covering fundamental programming concepts, algorithms, data structures, and web development.

## Goals

- Learn core programming concepts and algorithms
- Improve logical thinking and problem-solving skills
- Strengthen my technical base for future roles in cybersecurity and cloud
- Practice and showcase my work using Git and GitHub

## Repository Structure

Each week is organized in a separate folder. It contains problem sets, source code, and explanations of my approach.
