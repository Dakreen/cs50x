# Week 0 – Scratch

This is my project for Week 0 of Harvard's CS50x.

This week focused on introducing basic programming concepts like loops, conditions, and events using **Scratch**, a block-based visual language. While it’s great for beginners, I personally found this week quite easy and a bit boring — mainly because I’ve already explored basic programming before in other languages.

Still, I appreciate how CS50 starts from the ground up to make sure everyone has a solid foundation, and it was a good warm-up before diving into code.

I’ve included my Scratch project below along with a brief explanation of how it works.
